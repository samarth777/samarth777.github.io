I'm a **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **PES University** and a **Quantum Research Intern** at **IBM Research India**, where I work on building cutting-edge Agentic AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tools for quantum computing workflows.

My research focuses on advancing **multilingual and multimodal AI systems**. Previously at **CognitiveLab**, I developed the **Nayana Synthetic Dataset** with over 2M+ document images supporting OCR and VQA across 22+ languages. This work earned a **$100,000 Meta Llama Impact Grant** and has been published at top-tier venues including **NAACL**, **CVPR**, **ICCV**, **EMNLP**, and **ICML**.

I'm passionate about making AI more accessible and inclusive across languages and modalities. My projects span from **quantum computing** and **distributed AI systems** to **real-time data streaming** and **agricultural technology**. I've had the privilege of collaborating with leading researchers and contributing to open-source AI tools used by thousands worldwide.

When I'm not coding or researching, I'm exploring new ways to bridge the gap between theoretical AI advancements and practical, real-world applications that can benefit communities globally.
