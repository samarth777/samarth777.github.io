## Overview

Nayana is a groundbreaking project focused on advancing multilingual and multimodal AI through synthetic data generation. The project includes **SynthDoc**, a powerful library for generating synthetic documents, and the **Nayana Synthetic Dataset**, containing over 2M+ document images across 22+ languages.

## Key Achievements

- **Meta Llama Impact Grant**: Awarded **$100,000** for advancing multilingual GenAI
- **Publications**: Papers accepted at NAACL, CVPR, and ICCV workshops
- **Largest of its Kind**: Created the largest multilingual synthetic document dataset

## SynthDoc Library

A comprehensive synthetic document generation library with:

- Support for **22+ languages**
- Multiple fonts and layouts
- OCR, VQA, and layout analysis capabilities
- Scalable generation using Modal with **100 CPU and 10 GPU instances** in parallel

## Technical Innovation

- **Scalable Framework**: Adapts Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for low-resource languages
- **Multi-Task Support**: OCR, Visual Question Answering, and layout analysis
- **Production-Ready**: Used to train and finetune SOTA models

## Impact

The Nayana dataset addresses a critical gap in multilingual AI by providing high-quality training data for low-resource languages. This work enables more inclusive AI systems that can serve diverse linguistic communities.

## Recognition

- Meta Llama Impact Grant Winner ($100,000)
- Multiple workshop acceptances at top-tier venues (NAACL, CVPR, ICCV)
- Featured in the multilingual AI research community
