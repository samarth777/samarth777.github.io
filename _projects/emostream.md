## Overview

EmoStream is a scalable real-time emoji streaming and visualization system designed for live sports events. The project demonstrates expertise in distributed systems, stream processing, and high-concurrency architectures.

## Architecture

### Event-Driven Design
- **Pub-Sub Architecture**: Decoupled producer-consumer model
- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform
- **Spark Streaming**: Real-time data processing
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for visualization

### Scalability Features
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Kafka cluster for high throughput
- **Stream Processing**: Spark for parallel data processing
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution across multiple consumers

## Technical Implementation

### Components
1. **Producers**: Generate emoji events based on user interactions
2. **Kafka Brokers**: Manage event streams with high availability
3. **Spark Streaming**: Process and aggregate emoji data in real-time
4. **Flask Endpoint**: Serve processed data to visualization clients

### Performance Testing
- **Locust**: High-concurrency load testing
- **Stress Testing**: Validated performance under heavy traffic
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting

## Technical Stack

- **Streaming**: Apache Kafka
- **Processing**: Apache Spark Streaming
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Load Testing**: Locust
- **Big Data**: Hadoop ecosystem

## Use Cases
