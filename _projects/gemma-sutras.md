## Overview

The Gemma Sutras is a research project focused on fine-tuning Google's Gemma 3 language model for the specialized task of Sanskrit Sandhi Splitting. This work addresses one of the fundamental challenges in Sanskrit Natural Language Processing.

## Background

### What is Sandhi?

In Sanskrit, **Sandhi** (संधि) refers to the phonetic changes that occur when words are combined. When speaking or writing Sanskrit, adjacent sounds undergo transformations according to complex linguistic rules. For example:

- रामः + अयम् → रामोऽयम्
- सः + आगच्छति → स आगच्छति

### The Challenge

**Sandhi Splitting** is the reverse process - taking a combined form and breaking it back into its constituent words. This is essential for:

- Understanding Sanskrit texts
- Building Sanskrit NLP systems
- Automated translation and analysis
- Making ancient texts more accessible

## Technical Approach

### Model Selection

- **Base Model**: Gemma 3 by Google
- **Fine-tuning Strategy**: Specialized training on Sanskrit Sandhi patterns
- **Dataset**: Curated corpus of Sanskrit texts with annotated Sandhi splits

### Innovation

- Adapting modern large language models for classical language tasks
- Handling complex linguistic rules through neural approaches
- Creating a practical tool for Sanskrit scholars and researchers

## Research Impact

### Academic Recognition

- **ICML 2025 NewInML Workshop** (Non-Archival)
- **EMNLP 2025 WiNLP Workshop** (Archival)

### Real-World Applications

- **Digital Humanities**: Enabling computational analysis of Sanskrit literature
- **Education**: Helping students learn Sanskrit grammar
- **Text Processing**: Automated processing of historical texts
- **Preservation**: Making ancient knowledge more accessible

## Collaboration

**Authors**: Samarth P and Sanjay Mahalingam

This project demonstrates the power of combining modern AI techniques with traditional linguistic knowledge, creating tools that bridge ancient wisdom with contemporary technology.

## Broader Significance

The Gemma Sutras project contributes to:

- **Low-resource Language NLP**: Techniques applicable to other classical languages
- **Cultural Preservation**: Using AI to maintain and promote linguistic heritage
- **Interdisciplinary Research**: Uniting computational linguistics and Sanskrit studies

By making Sanskrit texts more computationally accessible, this work helps preserve and propagate one of humanity's oldest and most sophisticated linguistic traditions.
