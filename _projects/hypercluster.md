## Overview

HyperCluster is an ambitious project building a peer-to-peer distributed framework for deploying quantized large language models on edge devices. The system enables collaborative AI inference across consumer hardware, making powerful AI models accessible without expensive cloud infrastructure.

## Key Features

### Distributed Architecture

- **Self-organizing network** with automatic peer discovery
- **Fault tolerance** using Iroh protocol
- **Dynamic layer offloading** for efficient resource utilization

### Advanced Quantization

- **BitNet quantization** for extreme model compression
- **Model sharding** across network nodes
- Support for **llama.cpp** inference engine

### Edge Computing

- Runs on **consumer hardware**
- No centralized cloud infrastructure required
- Collaborative execution across peers

## Technical Stack

- **Networking**: Iroh for P2P communication
- **Inference**: llama.cpp
- **Quantization**: BitNet
- **Languages**: Go, Python, Rust

## Vision

HyperCluster aims to democratize access to large language models by enabling communities to pool their computing resources. This approach reduces dependence on centralized cloud providers and makes AI more accessible globally.

## Current Status

The project is actively under development with core networking and quantization components being implemented. The system will support multiple LLM architectures and provide seamless peer discovery and load balancing.
