## From Classical to Quantum

In June 2025, I joined **IBM Research India** as a Quantum Research Intern, focusing on AI for Quantum Computing. This intersection of two cutting-edge fields is where some of the most exciting innovations are happening.

## The Challenge: Quantum Software Development

Quantum computing is revolutionary, but it comes with unique challenges:

### The Complexity Problem

- **Quantum circuits are hard to design**: Requires deep understanding of quantum mechanics
- **Different from classical programming**: New paradigms, new debugging challenges
- **Rapid evolution**: Qiskit and quantum tools are constantly evolving
- **Language barriers**: Most quantum code is in Python, but performance-critical parts need Rust

### The Developer Experience Problem

Quantum developers need tools that:
1. Understand quantum concepts and constraints
2. Generate correct, optimized quantum circuits
3. Provide intelligent suggestions for common patterns
4. Assist with migration and refactoring

## Our Solutions: Agentic AI for Quantum

### Project 1: Qiskit to Rust Migration Agent

**The Goal**: Automate migration of Qiskit codebase from Python to Rust

**Why This Matters**:
- Rust provides better performance for quantum simulations
- Memory safety is critical for quantum algorithms
- IBM is transitioning core Qiskit components to Rust

**What We Built**:
A CLI-based AI coding agent that:
- Analyzes Python Qiskit code
- Understands quantum-specific patterns (gates, circuits, transpilation)
- Generates idiomatic Rust code
- Preserves quantum circuit semantics
- Assists developers with testing and validation

**Key Challenges**:
1. **Semantic Preservation**: Quantum gates must behave identically
2. **API Differences**: Python and Rust Qiskit APIs don't map 1:1
3. **Performance**: Rust code should be faster, not just equivalent
4. **Testing**: Quantum circuits need special validation

### Project 2: Enhanced Qiskit Code Assistant

**The Goal**: Augment Qiskit Code Assistant with agentic capabilities

**What is Qiskit Code Assistant?**
An AI tool for quantum developers, similar to GitHub Copilot but quantum-aware.

**Our Enhancements**:

**1. Autonomous Decision Making**
- Selects appropriate quantum gates for desired operations
- Chooses optimal transpilation strategies
- Suggests circuit optimizations

**2. Intelligent Code Generation**
- Context-aware quantum circuit construction
- Pattern recognition for common quantum algorithms
- Automatic documentation with quantum explanations

**3. Dynamic Workflow Orchestration**
- Manages multi-step quantum experiments
- Handles device selection and job submission
- Integrates with IBM Quantum systems

### Project 3: Qiskit Studio AI Integration

**Qiskit Studio** is IBM's visual IDE for quantum computing. We're making it smarter with AI:

- **Natural language to quantum circuits**: "Create a quantum teleportation circuit"
- **Interactive debugging**: AI suggests fixes for quantum errors
- **Optimization recommendations**: Real-time suggestions for circuit improvements
- **Learning assistance**: Contextual explanations of quantum concepts

### Project 4: RAG for Quantum Workflows

**The Problem**: Quantum computing documentation is vast and complex

**The Solution**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot

**Features**:
- Instant answers to Qiskit questions
- Code examples from documentation
- Best practices for quantum circuit design
- Troubleshooting quantum errors
- Latest updates from Qiskit releases

## Technical Deep Dive: Building Quantum-Aware Agents

### Understanding Quantum Context

Unlike classical code, quantum code has special properties:

**Superposition**: Qubits exist in multiple states
- Agent must understand quantum state evolution

**Entanglement**: Qubits are correlated
- Code generation must preserve entanglement patterns

**Measurement**: Irreversible collapse
- Placement of measurements is critical

**No-cloning theorem**: Can't copy quantum states
- Agent must avoid classical assumptions
