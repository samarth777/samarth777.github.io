## The Problem

Research papers are dense. Mathematical concepts can be abstract. And for many learners, the gap between reading a paper and truly _understanding_ it feels insurmountable.

What if we could automatically transform research papers into visual, animated explanations? That's exactly what we set out to build with **Manimator**.

## What is Manimator?

Manimator is an AI-powered tool that takes research papers from arXiv or mathematical concepts as input and generates animated visual explanations using the Manim engine (the same tool used by 3Blue1Brown for his famous math videos).

### Key Features

- **Automatic Animation Generation**: Just provide an arXiv paper ID or describe a concept
- **Manim-Powered**: Leverages the professional animation library used by top math educators
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Built with FastAPI and Gradio for easy access
- **Docker Support**: Deploy anywhere with containerization

## The Launch

We deployed Manimator on Hugging Face Spaces, and the response was overwhelming:

- **15,000+ uses within the first week**
- **Featured as Hugging Face's Space of the Week**
- Used by researchers, students, and educators worldwide

## Technical Deep Dive

### The Pipeline

1. **Input Processing**: Parse arXiv papers or user-provided mathematical concepts
2. **LLM Analysis**: Use large language models to understand the core concepts
3. **Scene Generation**: Convert understanding into Manim animation code
4. **Rendering**: Execute Manim to create the final video

### Challenges We Solved

**Challenge 1: Understanding LaTeX Math**

- Research papers are full of complex mathematical notation
- Solution: Fine-tuned our prompts to handle LaTeX and mathematical reasoning

**Challenge 2: Generating Valid Manim Code**

- Manim has a specific API and syntax
- Solution: Built a structured generation pipeline with validation steps

**Challenge 3: Scalability**

- Rendering animations is compute-intensive
- Solution: Optimized with Docker and efficient resource management

## Real-World Impact

### Education

Students use Manimator to:

- Understand complex papers in their courses
- Create presentation materials
- Build intuition for abstract concepts

### Research Communication

Researchers leverage it to:

- Visualize their own work for presentations
- Make their papers more accessible
- Create supplementary materials for publications

## What We Learned

1. **Demand for Accessibility**: There's huge demand for tools that make technical content more accessible
2. **Power of Visualization**: Visual explanations significantly improve comprehension
3. **Community Matters**: Open-source deployment led to valuable feedback and use cases we never imagined

## Publication

Our work on Manimator was accepted at **ICML 2025 NewInML Workshop**, validating the research contribution behind the engineering effort.

## Try It Yourself

Manimator is open-source and available on Hugging Face. Whether you're a student trying to understand a difficult paper or a researcher wanting to visualize your work, give it a try!

## What's Next?

We're working on:

- Support for more paper formats (not just arXiv)
- Interactive animations where users can adjust parameters
- Integration with note-taking and learning management systems
- Better handling of figures and diagrams from original papers
